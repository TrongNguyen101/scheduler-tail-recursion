# Thinking how to proceed with the above data structure, I would create a class called Timetable
# I would create a method called generate_timetable
# I would create a method called display_timetable
# I would create a method to create class on morning or afternoon
# Stupid code, out of process
# Stupid developer, go out and take a litle bit of fresh air or drink a cup of coffee
